# Experimennt No. 01
## Experiment Title: MATLAB implementation of-

1.	Plotting mirror signal, delayed signal and advanced signal of a continuous signal.
2.	Plotting mirror signal, delayed signal and advanced signal of a discrete signal.
3.	Convoluting two signals with and without using conv() function.

## Theory
A continuous signal or a continuous-time signal is a varying quantity whose domain, which is often time, is a continuum. That is, the function's domain is an uncountable set. The function itself need not to be continuous.
A discrete signal or discrete-time signal is a time series consisting of a sequence of quantities. Unlike a continuous-time signal, a discrete-time signal is not a function of a continuous argument; however, it may have been obtained by sampling from a continuous-time signal.
The convolution of two signals in the time domain is equivalent to the multiplication of their representation in frequency domain. 
y(n)=x(n)∗h(n)
Mathematically, we can write the convolution of two signals as-
y(n)=∑_(k=-∞)^∞▒〖x(k)*h(n-k)〗
