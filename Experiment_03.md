# Experiment No. 03
## Experiment Title: MATLAB implementation of-
1.	Auto Correlation of a function with and without xcorr() Function.
2.	Cross Correlation of a function with and without xcorr() Function.



## Theory
Correlation describes the mutual relationship which exists between two or more things. The same definition holds good even in the case of signals. That is, correlation between signals indicates the measure up to which the given signal resembles another signal.
Depending on whether the signals considered for correlation are same or different, we have two kinds of correlation: autocorrelation and cross-correlation.
Auto correlation is a type of correlation in which the given signal is correlated with itself, usually the time-shifted version of itself. On the other hand, cross correlation is a kind of correlation, in which the signal in-hand is correlated with another signal so as to know how much resemblance exists between them.

## Conclusion
Thus we have successfully implemented all the signals in MATLAB. The output was found same when done with and without xcorr() function.
